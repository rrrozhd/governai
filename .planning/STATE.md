## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4-phase order driven by dependency graph — foundations before assets, assets before runtime depth, audit enrichment before memory connector.
- Architecture: All new injectable dependencies follow "Protocol + No-Op Default" pattern; persistence backends use ABC, consumer-facing providers use typing.Protocol.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Confirm Zeroth's existing version string format in contracts/registry.py before finalizing ContractVersion model (SUMMARY.md gap).
- Phase 1: Validate asyncio.wait_for + Python 3.12 CancelledError propagation behavior in GovernAI's policy evaluation pattern before shipping.
- All phases: Every phase that touches RunState must include a v0.2.2 deserialization fixture test.
